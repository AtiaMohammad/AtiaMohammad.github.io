But when I was in primary school I've participated in many drawing competitions in which I stood among the top 10 students. When I was in secondary school I've participated in Debate competitions and won some of those. not only debate competitions, but I've participated in Science fairs, school football tournaments, and many more. After those little achievements, my biggest achievement is getting admission in United International University.</br></h1></b></i><br><br>
